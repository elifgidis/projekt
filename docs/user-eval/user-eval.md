## 01: [Increasing User Engagement and Learning through Personalized Feedback]

### Meta

Status
: **Done**

Updated
: 01.02.2024

### Goal

The primary goal is to provide users with a seamless learning experience, enabling them to enhance their knowledge over time efficiently and enjoyably. 

### Method
To achieve our goal, we have taken a personal approach to collecting feedback:
I involved friends and family in the testing phase and asked them to use the app a few times to gather real feedback on usability, content and appeal.

### Results
Our feedback collection strategy provided valuable insights:

-Friends and family reported that the registration process took less than 30 seconds, a significant improvement over previous measurements.
-Feedback revealed higher levels of engagement with tests related to history and general culture, with users appreciating the depth and variety of questions.
-Minor technical glitches were reported, but these did not significantly hinder the overall app experience.

### Implications
Feedback from this evaluation led to several actionable insights:

-I redesigned the navigation flow of the app, and we decided to make key features such as test results easily accessible.
-The positive reception of the history and literature tests motivated me to expand our database of questions in these areas.
-I improved the stability and performance of the app by prioritizing fixing minor technical glitches reported
