### My observation

During the course of the project I had to take on the responsibility of handling every aspect on my own, an experience that was extremely educational as well as challenging. Especially in terms of managing time effectively, balancing multiple tasks at the same time and ensuring that each component of the project met high standards.When I worked on the project, I did everything by myself. I learned a lot, but it was sometimes quite challenging. 

### Effect on Me
Running the project on my own improved my problem-solving skills and my ability to work independently. But this experience also showed me the importance of teamwork. Collaborating with others brings different perspectives, can distribute the workload and lead to better results. I also realized the need for better time management and the benefits of sharing responsibilities to avoid burnout and maintain high quality of work.

### Tip for the Future
In the future, I will take care to choose a partner with whom we share a common understanding of work ethics. This will not only improve the overall quality of the project, but also make the process more enjoyable and less burdensome. I also aim to improve my time management strategies by setting realistic deadlines and milestones to efficiently monitor progress.
