I was able to successfully build a robust database and launch a fully functional application. The current application runs without errors and provides a seamless and user-friendly experience for its users. The platform is free of technical glitches & let's the user complete the journey to get their score reviewed. 

There were a few goals that I missed. First, I wanted to add a timing feature for each question. I was hoping that this feature would put users under time pressure and help them manage their time. Unfortunately, this feature did not materialize within the project timeline.
Also not completed was the development and integration of an admin interface that would allow administrators to easily add, edit or delete questions and answers. This interface was crucial in order to innovate the content and adapt the tests more dynamically according to user feedback. I started this project with the intention of collaborating with a partner. However, due to difficulties in connecting and coordinating with my intended teammate, I continued to run the project alone. This unforeseen situation required a change in my approach.


Recognizing the value of collaboration, I aim to explore ways to overcome connectivity and coordination challenges in future teamwork. The effort put in developing the application alone led to continuous improvement in my approach to software development.
